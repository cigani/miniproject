Implemented a single-compartment model with an additional
M-type current, i.e. a slow voltage-dependent potassium
current, inducing spike-frequency adaptation.

Differential equation for the M-type current channel used
in order to avoid long optimization of the parameters.

TODO: Burst Current Simulation
      Gaussian White Noise Simulation

OPTIONAL: Implement afterhyperpolarization adaptation
